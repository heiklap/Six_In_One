Six_In_One       DART project to learn to build common libraries..
==========

Six small and separate DART programs, wich all use common, very small libraries.  

This is idea of:  How to start, when you want someday write a BIG Dart application.  
If you start right away doing a big app, it surely gets soon messy.

1.  Making happy_joy.dart, just 1-2 screens. 
    Put its common classes in 1-3 separate libraries.  

2.  build (fully separated) program 2, happy_dance.dart  
    find more things that you can put in common libraries... create one new library

3.  Happy_Day.dart ... more libraries...

.....

6.  happy_six.dart    ... 


In Dart editor all six happy_xxxx.dart programs with their   main-sections are in 
same folder, and you can runeach of them separate....  

Or can you?   does editors file-system prevent this...?


SO:  altogether..  i think this is good way of sketching, what kind of common classes you need.
